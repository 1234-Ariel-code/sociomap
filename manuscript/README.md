# SOCIOMAP: Mapping sociogenomic inequities in chronic disease risk in Nigeria

## Abstract

Nigeria is home to extensive sociocultural diversity and substantial genetic variation, yet remains underrepresented in data-driven health research. Here we develop an interpretable, end-to-end machine learning framework to quantify how chronic disease burden varies across sociodemographic strata in a nationally representative Nigerian cohort of ~45,000 individuals. We harmonize ICD-10 diagnoses, lifestyle factors, and sociodemographic variables and derive binary disease phenotypes for downstream analyses. We first map disease prevalence and multimorbidity patterns and then test group-wise heterogeneity across tribe, religion, income, and education using chi-squared association analyses. Next, we train gradient-boosted tree models to predict disease risk and apply SHAP to identify transparent, subgroup-aware drivers of prediction, highlighting contributions from adiposity (BMI), socioeconomic status, cultural affiliation proxies, and diet-related variables. Unsupervised embedding and clustering further reveal latent population subgroups enriched for distinct sociodemographic and lifestyle profiles, consistent with non-uniform risk architectures across the cohort. To support translation, we operationalize the framework in interactive Dash/Streamlit tools for risk scoring and explanation. Together, these results demonstrate that chronic disease risk in Nigeria is strongly structured by intersecting social and lifestyle dimensions and provide a scalable, open framework for equity-centered precision public health and future integration with polygenic scores and gene–environment interaction analyses.

## Introduction

Understanding how genetic susceptibility intersects with social and environmental context is central to advancing equitable healthcare. Over the past decade, large-scale genomic studies have uncovered thousands of loci associated with complex diseases, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a promising tool for individual-level risk stratification. However, the clinical and public health utility of these approaches remains unevenly distributed. Most genome-informed risk models have been developed in populations of European ancestry, resulting in limited portability and systematically reduced predictive performance in underrepresented populations, thereby risking the amplification of existing health disparities rather than their mitigation¹².
Africa harbours the greatest human genetic diversity globally³, yet remains profoundly underrepresented in genomic and health data science research. Nigeria–the most populous country in Africa, with over 200 million inhabitants and more than 250 ethnolinguistic groups–presents a uniquely informative setting in which to examine how genetic, sociocultural, and environmental factors jointly shape chronic disease risk. At the same time, Nigeria is undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition, with a growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease⁴. Despite this shift, there is a critical lack of scalable, interpretable analytical frameworks capable of characterizing disease burden in a manner that is both population-aware and actionable for public health decision-making.

Importantly, health outcomes are not determined by genetic predisposition alone. A substantial body of evidence highlights the role of social determinants–including ethnicity, religion, income, education, dietary practices, and access to healthcare–in influencing disease onset, progression, and outcomes⁵⁶. In multi-ethnic and socioeconomically stratified societies such as Nigeria, these factors are deeply embedded in cultural norms and lived experience, and may mediate, modify, or even dominate genetic risk. Yet, systematic approaches for integrating such sociodemographic dimensions into disease risk modeling–particularly in African populations–remain limited, and are often treated as confounders rather than as primary explanatory variables.
Here, we present an interpretable, AI-driven framework for the discovery of polygenic–sociodemographic interactions underlying chronic disease risk in Nigeria. Using a nationally representative cohort of approximately 45,000 individuals, we integrate structured phenotypic data, ICD-10–coded diagnoses, lifestyle indicators, and sociodemographic variables into a unified analytical pipeline grounded in principles of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and precision public health. Rather than prioritizing predictive performance alone, our framework is explicitly designed to generate transparent, subgroup-aware insights that can inform policy, prevention strategies, and future genomic integration.

Our approach comprises four core components. First, we develop a robust preprocessing and feature engineering pipeline that harmonizes raw clinical and survey data, including the transformation of free-text and coded ICD-10 diagnoses into interpretable binary disease phenotypes. Second, we perform comprehensive epidemiologic profiling of disease prevalence and multimorbidity, enabling fine-grained characterization of chronic disease burden across Nigeria’s sociocultural landscape. Third, we quantify stratified disease heterogeneity across tribe, religion, income, education, and lifestyle factors using chi-squared association testing, nonlinear embedding (UMAP), and unsupervised clustering (KMeans), revealing latent population subgroups with distinct risk architectures. Fourth, we train supervised gradient-boosted tree models and apply SHAP-based explanations to identify interpretable drivers of disease risk at both the population and subgroup levels, enabling risk auditing and alignment with established epidemiological patterns.

Unlike traditional genomic studies that rely primarily on genotype data, this work focuses on the sociogenomic layer of disease risk–establishing a necessary foundation for the equitable deployment of polygenic models in African settings. To facilitate translation, we operationalize the framework through open-source, interactive dashboards built with Dash and Streamlit, enabling real-time risk scoring, subgroup comparison, and explainable model interrogation by researchers, clinicians, and policymakers.
By embedding local sociocultural context directly into the modeling pipeline, this study contributes to a new generation of equity-centered AI frameworks for health research. Our approach directly addresses the limitations of Eurocentric risk models and aligns with broader calls to decolonize health data science and promote inclusive innovation⁷⁸. More broadly, it provides a scalable blueprint for other Global South contexts facing similar challenges of health disparity, data marginalization, and limited access to interpretable analytic tools (sociomap/Fig. 1).
