# SOCIOMAP

Quote: “Imagine being able to predict who is most at risk of hypertension not just from their genes, but from their tribe, diet, religion, and income. In Africa, where health inequities are deeply rooted in both biological diversity and sociocultural complexity, such insight is urgently needed.”, Authors.

**SOCIOMAP** is an interpretable, equity-centered machine learning framework for mapping sociodemographic and lifestyle structuring of chronic disease risk in Nigeria using a nationally representative cohort (~45,000 individuals). The project integrates ICD-10 phenotyping, stratified epidemiology, statistical association testing, supervised risk modeling (XGBoost), explainability (SHAP), unsupervised subgroup discovery (UMAP + KMeans), and interactive dashboards (Dash/Streamlit).
